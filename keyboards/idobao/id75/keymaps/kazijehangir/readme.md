# The default keymap for idobo

Compile using `qmk compile -kb idobo -km kazijehangir`.
Flash using `qmk flash -kb idobo -km kazijehangir`.

Set defaults using `qmk config user.keyboard=idobo`.

Was having issues with missed keypresses
Turned the tapping term to 150 instead of the default 200
Also turned off the RGB LEDs 
Maybe it's better now
Apparently should not lube the contact leafs
